# Informed

Informed is an app to display information about an election and its candidates.
Uses information from the backend at [InformedWeb](https://github.com/LePips/InformedWeb)

# Technologies and Strategies Used
- Rest frameworks
- Lots of table views and a proper way to build and handle them
- Lots of REST calls
- Carthage integration
- Auto layout made easy
- React instead of MVC

# Disclaimer
I don't have the time to clean it up, as it has been a long work in progress.
