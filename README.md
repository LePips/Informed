# Informed

Informed is an app with the goal to help the common citizen become informed about political elections and political figures.
The key point is that this is `crowd sourced` allowing anyone to submit information, like Wikipedia, but fact checked and peer reviewed.

ie: I won't know anything about the Alabama Governor race going on because I live in another state.

The information for the app is currently hosted on Firebase.
